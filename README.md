Not particularly well organized or well optimized. More lenient than the JSON
spec on parsing floats and on allowing trailing commas in objects and arrays.

Completed over the course of a couple hours. Since I've never written a JSON
parser or a parser in Zig, it seemed like a good exercise. 

It is not meant to be used. Use the standard library JSON parser instead.
